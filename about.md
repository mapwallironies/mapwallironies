    <h1>About MWI</h1>
    <p>Hi there, and thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <p>Over the years, this space has taken many different forms, but I’m excited to finally have something that feels right; a place to share what I enjoy, without any grand artistic mission or deep philosophical undertones.  Just me, the things that make me happy, and a way to remember and share them with others.</p>
    <p>One of the big drivers behind this site was stepping away from social media, at least from the feeling of cyclical forced interactions with pre-determined content.  While I appreciate the connections it makes possible, I think there’s a better way; something more personal, more intentional.  This space is my way of keeping the best parts while leaving behind the noise.</p>
    <p>I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have blended so much travel with unforgettable memories, and meeting some truly wonderful people.  This is a little corner of the internet where I can collect those experiences, tell some stories, and hopefully connect with others in a way that feels meaningful.  Looking forward to expanding this over time; we'll see where it goes!</p>
    <p>Cheers, Will</p>
