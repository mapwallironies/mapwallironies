# About Me

Hi there! Thanks for visiting my online portfolio.  Over the years, I've had several private iterations, but it’s always been a goal of mine to create something more public-facing to share my work with the world.  Bonus: this also allows me to drop the last of my social media!

Here, you'll find a mix of urban and natural photography, art projects, and soon, some connections to the program management and customer success work I focus on day-to-day.

Thanks again for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy what you see!  Please don’t hesitate to reach out for any inquiries or collaborations.

Cheers,
Will
