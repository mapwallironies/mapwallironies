    <h1>About MWI</h1>
    <p>Hi there, and thanks for stopping by.</p>
    <<p>Over the years, this space has taken many forms, but I’m excited to finally have something that feels right; a place to share what I enjoy, without any grand artistic mission or deep philosophical undertones.  Just me, the things that make me happy, and a way to remember and share them with others.</p>
    <p>While I never spent a ton of time on them, I have to say I'm very much looking forward to using this instead of social media and dealing with the cyclical pre-determined content.  While I appreciate the connections it makes possible, I feel like this will be more personal.</p>
    <p>I’ve been incredibly fortunate to have blended so much travel with unforgettable memories, and meeting some truly wonderful people.  This is a little corner where I can collect those experiences, tell some stories, and hopefully keep connecting with others.  Looking forward to expanding this over time; we'll see where it goes!</p>
    <p>Cheers, Will</p>
